# 09/27-weather

This project is all about building a dynamic weather application that can provide real-time weather information for user's current location.

This will be a full stack project, will build frontend as well as api which can be used independently. I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to initiate the project and will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) and for styling [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). also will use this api to fetch latest weather data [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api).
